## Repository Structure
The repository is based around Unity with a commonly used gitignore file. All files in the repository should be mandatory for building the product. 

## Document Note
The project release plan, research information, sprint plans, sprint reports, and other sprint information can be found in the folder named "ProjectDocuments". Sprint plans aside, these documents are likely to change.
